# Tasks:

* The software should be written java or at least in a jvm based technology. But better with java
* We’d love to see cucumber or rest assured being used, but if you have something even better, be our guest and show off some skills!
* We don’t ask for extreme coverage numbers and we’re very curious on what you think is enough and which conclusions you draw from what you see.
* If you put your code into a publicly available repository, please make sure you keep the base url and the wa_key private.

# Requirements:

* Fork this repository https://github.com/LiviaGitHub/Auto1
* Install bundler - gem install bundler
* Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies

# How run the Scenario:

* Open the terminal and run `mvn test`

Obs: I have no knowledge of automated testing "RestFul" and "rest assured", I have developed what I could by searching the internet.
